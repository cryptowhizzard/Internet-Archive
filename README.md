🌍 Project: Internet Archive EU Storage Initiative

Category: Data Preservation / Infrastructure
Partners: Internet Archive, MetDeZon / Curio Operator Group
Region: European Union

🧩 Description

The Internet Archive EU Storage Initiative supports the long-term preservation of open and accessible information by helping the Internet Archive store its data on the Filecoin network, hosted within the European Union.

Our infrastructure ensures that Internet Archive data is stored reliably, redundantly, and compliantly using Curio-based Filecoin miners operated in EU data centers.
A strong focus is placed on retrievability — the Internet Archive performs daily retrieval tests to verify that all stored data remains accessible and functional.

We work in close collaboration with the Curio development team to ensure compatibility, performance, and stability improvements for large-scale archival storage.
Our 24/7 Network Operations Center (NOC) actively monitors all storage nodes and retrieval endpoints, ensuring continuous uptime and fast response to any anomaly.

Importantly, there are already live, verified use cases where users retrieve Internet Archive content that is physically stored and served from our EU-based Filecoin nodes — proving that Filecoin can deliver real-world, censorship-free access to open knowledge.

🌐 Impact

Demonstrates a real-world use case for Filecoin with active retrievals from a global open data partner.

Strengthens Filecoin’s role as a censorship-resistant and verifiable storage network for public information.

Expands the Internet Archive’s distributed presence into the EU, improving decentralization and data sovereignty.

Provides GDPR-compliant and retrievability-tested storage for European data collections.

Operates under a 24/7 NOC, ensuring continuous reliability and transparency.

Builds trust in Filecoin as a global backbone for open, censorship-free, and durable information access.

🚀 Status

Partnership established with the Internet Archive.

Initial data batches successfully onboarded to Filecoin miners within the EU.

Daily retrievability testing by the Internet Archive confirms consistent accessibility.

Active retrieval scenarios verified: content fetched from the Internet Archive is being served directly from our EU-based Filecoin infrastructure.

Ongoing collaboration with the Curio team to optimize retrieval reliability and sealing efficiency.

Scaling operations to onboard additional terabytes of open data under EU compliance.

🔭 Looking Ahead

We aim to further scale the EU storage footprint for Internet Archive data, add additional retrievability endpoints, and release a public dashboard showing stored datasets, retrieval performance, and integrity metrics.
This initiative serves as one of the first fully operational, real-world Filecoin use cases connecting global open data institutions to decentralized storage.
